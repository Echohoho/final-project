# How far does it cover?
This map explores how far Indigo bike can go. An Indigo pass holder can rent the bike for 1h. So one can go as far as 30 min away from any station without extra fee. 30 min cycling in city would be something like 3.6 km. Central city, University City, and Fairmount Park which is ideal for cycling is well served. The map is drawn in QGIS.
